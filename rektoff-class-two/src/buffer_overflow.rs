// - Pointer Arithmetic: When you use ptr.add(i), you're performing pointer arithmetic.
//    This means you're moving the pointer i bytes forward from the start of the buffer.

// - Out-of-Bounds Access: The loop iterates from 0 to 4, which means you're trying to access memory locations beyond the allocated buffer:
// 	- For i = 0, *ptr.add(0) accesses buffer[0], which is 0.
// 	- For i = 1, *ptr.add(1) accesses buffer[1], which is 0.
// 	- For i = 2, *ptr.add(2) accesses buffer[2], which is 0.
// 	- For i = 3, *ptr.add(3) accesses buffer[3], which is 0.
// 	- For i = 4, *ptr.add(4) accesses memory just after the buffer, which is technically out of bounds.
//     This is where undefined behavior starts.
